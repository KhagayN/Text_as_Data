She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born.  He just hugged me and said: ""You've done your job, mom.","Louis.  Their presence dispelled the alarms of our fellow citizens on those disorders, and overawed the hostile purposes of the Indians.  The perpetrators of the murders were surrendered to the authority and operation of our laws, and every appearance of purposed hostility from those Indian tribes has subsided.",2008,1828, ,1, 
101000002,In the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period.  The Department of Agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency.  The department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture.,"And yet, day in and day out, we see a long procession of timid and fearful men who wring their hands and cry out that we have lost the way, that we don't know what we are doing, that we are bound to fail.  Some say we should give up the struggle for peace, and others say we should have a war and get it over with.  That's a terrible statement.",1929,1952, ,2, 
101000003,"We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need.  We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we learned as children.  That's how we sustain the state of the Union.","We should substitute for comparatively inefficient types   the old third-class battleship Texas, the single-turreted monitors above mentioned, and, indeed, all the monitors and some of the old cruisers   efficient, modern seagoing vessels.  Seagoing torpedo-boat destroyers should be substituted for some of the smaller torpedo boats.  During the present Congress there need be no additions to the aggregate number of units of the navy.",1993,1906, ,1,

SITUATION AFTER READJUSTMENT.","The Soviet rulers have made it clear that we must have strength as well as right on our side.  If we build our strength--and we are building it--the Soviet rulers may face the facts and lay aside their plans to take over the world.  That is what we hope will happen, and that is what we are trying to bring about.",1912,1951, ,2, 
101000005,"I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future may require.  We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once.  Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear.","And the American uniform is once again worn with pride.  Most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway, and we will be addressing one key system, the MX missile, in consultation with the Congress in a few months.  America's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism, strength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies, and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries.",1968,1986, ,1, 
101000006,"The danger to American democracy lies not in the least in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and accountable hands.  It lies in having the power insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for its use.  Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account.","With faith and courage, we can perform great deeds and take freedom's next step.  And we will.  We will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light where there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where there was disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was only bloodshed.",1909,1987, ,2, 
101000007,"If it be said that we are not bound to keep faith with rebels, let it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels only.  Thousands of true men in the South were drawn to our standard by it, and hundreds of thousands in the North gave their lives in the belief that it would be carried out.  It was made on the day after the first great battle of the war had been fought and lost.","Given their vast internal base of operations, and their agents in foreign lands, what are the communist rulers trying to do?  Inside their homeland, the communists are trying to maintain and modernize huge military forces.  And simultaneously, they are endeavoring to weld their whole vast area and population into a completely self-contained, advanced industrial society.",1868,1953, ,1,

RECLAMATION  The National Government is committed to a policy of reclamation and irrigation which it desires to establish on a sound basis and continue in the interest of the localities concerned.",In return the most rigid performance of duty should be exacted from them.  The reward should be ample when they do their best; and nothing less than their best should be tolerated.  It is idle to hope for the best results when the men in the senior grades come to those grades late in life and serve too short a time in them.,1926,1908, ,2, 
101000009,"Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear.  They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb.  And those who know the costs also know the stakes.","The question of securing a healthy, self-respecting, and mutually sympathetic attitude as between employer and employe, capitalist and wage-worker, is a difficult one.  All phases of the labor problem prove difficult when approached.  But the underlying principles, the root principles, in accordance with which the problem must be solved are entirely simple.",2009,1906, ,1, 
101000010,"We must not let this happen in our time.  We must avoid a paralysis of the will for peace and international security.  In the traditionally bipartisan areas--military security and foreign relations--I can report to you that I have already, with the leaders of this Congress, expressed assurances of unreserved cooperation.","And so, let the word go out: If you're caught and convicted, you will do time.  But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs.  So, some of this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs.",1956,1992, ,2, 
101000011,"Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow.  And they won't have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war.  My grandchildren don't have to do that and won't have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past.","The title of a best-selling book asked: ""America: What Went Wrong?""  In the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right.  We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans.",1995,2003, ,1, 
101000012,"Other great business interests are awakening to the need of forest preservation as a business matter.  The Government's forest work should receive from the Congress hearty support, and especially support adequate for the protection of the forest reserves against fire.  The forest-reserve policy of the Government has passed beyond the experimental stage and has reached a condition where scientific methods are essential to its successful prosecution.","We live in such times now, and we face such duties.  We've come through a long period of turmoil and doubt, but we've once again found our moral course, and with a new spirit, we are striving to express our best instincts to the rest of the world.  There is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common purpose.",1904,1980, ,2, 
101000013,"A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all.  If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in every way we can, the innocent.  And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.","However, this effort will not in itself assure our people of an adequate highway system.  On my recommendation, this problem has been carefully considered by the Conference of State Governors and by a special Advisory Committee on a National Highway Program, composed of leading private citizens.  I have received the recommendations of the Governors' Conference and will shortly receive the views of the special Advisory Committee.",2006,1956, ,1, 
101000014,"There will be special recommendations dealing with such subjects as atomic energy, the furthering of public works, the continued efforts to eliminate government competition with the businesses of tax-paying citizens.  A number of legislative recommendations will be mentioned specifically in my forthcoming Budget Message, which will reach you within the week.  That message will also recommend such sums as are needed to implement the proposed action.","I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore.  But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed.  I will not let it be repealed.",1958,1998, ,2, 
101000015,"But you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same -- full of dreams, ready to take on the world -- all special, because they are the very future of freedom.  And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.  And so, tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you.","A less decisive policy would probably have resulted in a long, bloody, and expensive war.""  These gentlemen conducted themselves to my entire satisfaction and rendered useful services in executing the humane intentions of the Government.  It also affords me great satisfaction to state that Governor Cumming has performed his duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the happiest effect.",1993,1859, ,1, 
101000016,"The statutory function of the National Security Council is to assist the President in the formulation and coordination of significant domestic, foreign, and military policies required for the security of the Nation.  In these days of tension it is essential that this central body have the vitality to perform effectively its statutory role.  I propose to see that it does so.","If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.",1954,2018, ,2,

That is what I hope.  But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried.","This cannot be achieved merely by exhortation.  It demands the concerted action of all those in responsible positions in the Government and the earnest cooperation of the Congress.  Already, we have begun an examination of the appropriations and expenditures of all departments in an effort to find significant items that may be decreased or canceled without damage to our essential requirements.",1971,1954, ,1,

As a result of those fundamental facts, we face some of the most serious challenges in the history of this nation.","Now, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, America should turn its back on the rest of the world.  Many around the world were afraid we would do just that.  But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our Nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world.",1983,1997, ,2, 
101000019,"As we go forward this year in the defense of freedom, let us keep dearly before us the nature of our present effort.  We are building up our strength, in concert with other free nations, to meet the danger of aggression that has been turned loose on the world.  The strength of the free nations is the world's best hope of peace.","The Department of Justice has for the last four years devoted more attention to the enforcement of the anti-trust legislation than to anything else.  Much has been accomplished, particularly marked has been the moral effect of the prosecutions; but it is increasingly evident that there will be a very insufficient beneficial result in the way of economic change.  The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another device to accomplish the same purpose.",1951,1906, ,1, 
101000020,"In a resolution adopted without opposition, the OAS General Assembly in November strongly supported the work of the Commission.  The American Convention on Human Rights is in force and an Inter-American Court has been created to judge human rights violations.  This convention has been pending before the Senate for two years; I hope the United States this year will join the other nations of the hemisphere in ratifying a convention which embodies principles that are our tradition.","In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.

101000021,"Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.  The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.","The problem is not an easy one.  A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of America in the world's affairs.  The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought,-the one believers in protection of American industries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only,-must be subordinated to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed conditions.",2019,1920, ,1, 
101000022,"It is a world of great natural diversity in geography and climate, in distribution of resources, in population, language, and living standards, in economic and cultural development.  It is a world whose people are not all convinced communists by any means.  It is a world where history and national traditions, particularly in its borderlands, tend more toward separation than unification, and run counter to the enforced combination that has been made of these areas today.","Yet if one thing is certain in our future, it is that more sacrifice still lies ahead.  Were we to grow discouraged now, were we to weaken and slack off, the whole structure we have built, these past eight years, would come apart and fall away.  Never then, no matter by what stringent means, could our free world regain the ground, the time, the sheer momentum, lost by such a move.",1953,1953, ,2,

It means more to me than I will ever be able to say.  Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a difference.",My Administration began the implementation of most of the ideas produced last year by that citizen's advisory body; others need to be addressed.  I have proposed the reconvening of the Conference next year to review progress; reassess priorities; and set new goals.  In the interim I hope that the incoming Administration and the new Congress will work with the committee I have established to keep these business development ideas alive and help implement Conference recommendations.,1997,1983, ,1, 
101000024,"In time of peace there can, at all events, be no justification for the creation of a permanent debt by the Federal Government.  Its limited range of constitutional duties may certainly under such circumstances be performed without such a resort.  It has, it is seen, been avoided during four years of greater fiscal difficulties than have existed in a similar period since the adoption of the Constitution, and one also remarkable for the occurrence of extraordinary causes of expenditures.","The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash.  We cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender, merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know they must have.

He said, ""We shall have much to do together; I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and good will.""","The result of the deliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners, will be communicated to Congress.  A treaty for the protection of trade-marks has been negotiated with Great Britain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its consideration.  The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by the accession of the successful party to power and the installation of its chief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office.",1990,1878, ,1, 
101000026,"This participation by State and individuals should be supplemented by an adequate showing of the varied and unique activities of the National Government.  The United States can not with good grace invite foreign governments to erect buildings and make expensive exhibits while itself refusing to participate.  Nor would it be wise to forego the opportunity to join with other nations in the inspiring interchange of ideas tending to promote intercourse, friendship, and commerce.","We are fighting, as our fathers have fought, to uphold the doctrine that all men are equal in the sight of God.  Those on the other side are striving to destroy this deep belief and to create a world in their own image   a world of tyranny and cruelty and serfdom.  That is the conflict that day and night now pervades our lives.",1913,1942, ,2, 
101000027,"I campaigned on the promise of change     change we can believe in, the slogan went.  And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren   t sure if they still believe we can change     or at least, that I can deliver it.  But remember this     I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I can do it alone.","Or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security needs, and use that power for colonial conquest?  The Soviet Union must realize that its decision to use military force in Afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values.

ARMY AND NAVY  For several years we have been decreasing the personnel of the Army and Navy, and reducing their power to the danger point.","I   ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts of once busy Main Streets.  I   ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who   ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear     proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.  They   re right.",1924,2014, ,2,

And yes, you have some duties yourself: Study hard in school; listen to your mom or dad; help someone in need; and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say, ""Thank you.""  And Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here in this great Chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free.","Combination of capital, like combination of labor, is a necessary element in our present industrial system.  It is not possible completely to prevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic.  What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their injuring the public, or existing in such forms as inevitably to threaten injury.",2007,1908, ,1,
